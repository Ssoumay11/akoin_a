Additional Tier 1 capital of the institution. 
[Note: This rule corresponds to Article 25 of CRR as it applied immediately before its revocation] 
CHAPTER 2 COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL 
SECTION 1 COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 ITEMS AND INSTRUMENTS 
Article 26 
COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 ITEMS 
1.  
Common Equity Tier 1 items of institutions consist of the following: 
(a)  subject to paragraph 3, capital instruments, provided that the conditions laid down in 
Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29 are met; 
(b)  share premium accounts related to the instruments referred to in point (a); 
(c)  retained earnings; 
(d)  accumulated other comprehensive income; 
(e)  other reserves.

losses as soon as these occur. 
 
 
 
 
 
PRA2025/11 
Page 5 of 43 
 
2.  
For the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, institutions shall not include interim or year-end 
profits in Common Equity Tier 1 capital before the institution has taken a formal decision 
confirming the final profit or loss of the institution for the year unless: 
(a)  
those profits have been verified by persons independent of the institution that are 
responsible for the auditing of the accounts of that institution; and 
(b)  
the institution has ensured that any foreseeable charge or dividend has been deducted 
from the amount of those profits. 
A verification of the interim or year-end profits of the institution shall provide an adequate level 
of assurance that those profits have been evaluated in accordance with the principles set out in 
the applicable accounting framework. 
Where the institution includes, pursuant to this paragraph, profits in Common Equity Tier 1 
capital, it shall notify the PRA as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. 
3.  
Institutions shall not classify issuances of capital instruments as Common Equity Tier 1 
instruments unless a 138BA permission has been granted by the PRA and the conditions laid 
down in Article 28 or, where applicable, Article 29 are met. By way of derogation, institutions 
may classify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments subsequent issuances of a form of Common 
Equity Tier 1 instruments for which they have already received a 138BA permission, provided 
that the provisions governing those subsequent issuances are identical to or substantially the 
same as the provisions governing those issuances for which the institutions have already 
received a 138BA permission.

of the institution or, where permitted under applicable national law of the United Kingdom, 
or any part of it, or of a third country, the management body of the institution; 
(b)  the instruments are fully paid up and the acquisition of ownership of those instruments is 
not funded directly or indirectly by the institution, and for this purpose only the part of a 
capital instrument that is fully paid up shall be eligible to qualify as a Common Equity Tier 
1 instrument; 
(c)  the instruments meet all the following conditions as regards their classification: 
(i)  they qualify as capital, which for these purposes comprises all amounts, regardless of 
their actual designations, which, in accordance with the legal structure of the 
institution concerned, are regarded under the applicable law of the United Kingdom, 
or any part of it, or of a third country, as equity capital subscribed by the shareholders 
or other proprietors; 
(ii)  they are classified as equity within the meaning of the applicable accounting 
framework; 
(iii)  they are classified as equity capital for the purposes of determining balance sheet 
insolvency, where applicable under national insolvency law of the United Kingdom, or

(d)  the instruments are clearly and separately disclosed on the balance sheet in the financial 
statements of the institution; 
(e)  the instruments are perpetual; 
(f)  the principal amount of the instruments may not be reduced or repaid, except in either of 
the following cases:

(ii)  discretionary repurchases of the instruments or other discretionary means of reducing 
capital, where the institution has received the prior 138BA permission of the PRA in 
accordance with Article 77; 
(g)  the provisions governing the instruments do not indicate expressly or implicitly that the 
principal amount of the instruments would be reduced, redeemed, repurchased or repaid 
(other than in the circumstances described in points (f)(i) and (f)(ii) above), and the 
institution does not otherwise provide such an indication prior to or at issuance of the 
instruments, except in the case of instruments referred to in Article 27 where the refusal by 
the institution to redeem such instruments is prohibited under applicable national law of the 
United Kingdom, or any part of it, or of a third country; 
(h)  the instruments meet the following conditions as regards distributions: 
(i)  there is no preferential distribution treatment regarding the order of distribution 
payments, including in relation to other Common Equity Tier 1 instruments, and the 
 
 
PRA2025/11 
Page 7 of 43 
 
terms governing the instruments do not provide preferential rights to payment of 
distributions; 
(ii)  distributions to holders of the instruments may be paid only out of distributable items; 
(iii)  the conditions governing the instruments do not include a cap or other restriction on 
the maximum level of distributions, except in the case of the instruments referred to in

(iv)  the level of distributions is not determined on the basis of the amount for which the 
instruments were purchased at issuance, except in the case of the instruments 
referred to in Article 27; 
(v)  the conditions governing the instruments do not include any obligation on the 
institution to make distributions to their holders and the institution is not otherwise 
subject to such an obligation; 
(vi)  non-payment of distributions does not constitute an event of default of the institution; 
(vii)  the cancellation of distributions imposes no restrictions on the institution; 
(i)  compared to all the own funds instruments issued by the institution, the instruments 
absorb the first and proportionately greatest share of losses as they occur, and each 
instrument absorbs losses to the same degree as all other Common Equity Tier 1 
instruments; 
(j)  the instruments rank below all other claims in the event of insolvency or liquidation of the 
institution, except claims from holders of ordinary shares which rank pari passu with the 
instruments; 
(k)  the instruments entitle their owners to a claim on the residual assets of the institution, 
which, in the event of its liquidation and after the payment of all senior claims, is 
proportionate to the amount of such instruments issued and is not fixed or subject to a cap, 
except in the case of the capital instruments referred to in Article 27; and, for the purposes 
of this point, a claim that is specified in terms of a percentage does not constitute a fixed or 
capped claim; 
(l)  the instruments are neither secured nor subject to a guarantee that enhances the seniority 
of the claim by any of the following: 
(i)  the institution or its subsidiaries; 
(ii)  the parent undertaking of the institution or its subsidiaries; 
(iii)  the parent financial holding company of the institution or its subsidiaries;

a write down on a permanent basis of the principal amount of Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 
instruments. 
The condition laid down in point (f) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding 
the reduction of the principal amount of the capital instrument within a resolution procedure or 
as a consequence of a write down of capital instruments required by the resolution authority 
responsible for the institution. 
 
 
PRA2025/11 
Page 8 of 43 
 
The condition laid down in point (g) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met notwithstanding 
the provisions governing the capital instrument indicating expressly or implicitly that the 
principal amount of the instrument would be reduced within a resolution procedure or as a 
consequence of a write down of capital instruments required by the resolution authority 
responsible for the institution. 
3.  
The condition laid down in point (h)(iii) of paragraph 1 shall be deemed to be met 
notwithstanding the instrument paying a dividend multiple, provided that such a dividend 
multiple does not result in a distribution that causes a disproportionate drag on own funds. 
4.  
For the purposes of point (h)(i) of paragraph 1, differentiated distributions shall only reflect 
differentiated voting rights. In this respect, higher distributions shall only apply to Common 
Equity Tier 1 instruments with fewer or no voting rights.

[Note 2: Related provisions in Articles 8 and 9 of Chapter 4 of the Own Funds (CRR) Part] 
Article 29 
CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY MUTUALS, CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES, 
SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS AND SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS 
1.  
Capital instruments issued by mutuals, co-operative societies, savings institutions and similar 
institutions shall qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments only if the conditions laid down in 
Article 28 with modifications resulting from the application of this Article are met. 
2.  
The following conditions shall be met as regards redemption of the capital instruments: 
(a)  except where prohibited under applicable national law of the United Kingdom, or any part 
of it, or of a third country, the institution shall be able to refuse the redemption of the 
instruments; 
(b)  where the refusal by the institution of the redemption of instruments is prohibited under 
applicable national law of the United Kingdom, or any part of it, or of a third country, the 
provisions governing the instruments shall give the institution the ability to limit their 
redemption; 
(c)  refusal to redeem the instruments, or the limitation of the redemption of the instruments 
where applicable, may not constitute an event of default of the institution. 
3.  
The capital instruments may include a cap or restriction on the maximum level of distributions 
only where that cap or restriction is set out under applicable national law of the United 
Kingdom, or any part of it, or of a third country, or the statute of the institution. 
4.  
Where the capital instruments provide the owner with rights to the reserves of the institution in 
the event of insolvency or liquidation that are limited to the nominal value of the instruments, 
such a limitation shall apply to the same degree to the holders of all other Common Equity Tier 
1 instruments issued by that institution. The condition laid down in the first subparagraph is 
without prejudice to the possibility for a mutual, co-operative society, savings institution or a 
similar institution to recognise within Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that do not afford 
voting rights to the holder and that meet all the following conditions: 
(a)  the claim of the holders of the non-voting instruments in the insolvency or liquidation of the 
institution is proportionate to the share of the total Common Equity Tier 1 instruments that 
those non-voting instruments represent; 
(b)  the instruments otherwise qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. 
5.  
Where the capital instruments entitle their owners to a claim on the assets of the institution in 
the event of its insolvency or liquidation that is fixed or subject to a cap, such a limitation shall

(a)  the amount of holdings required to be deducted pursuant to paragraph 1; 
(b)  the proportion of the aggregate amount of direct, indirect and synthetic holdings by the
